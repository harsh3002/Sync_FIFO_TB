FIFO Testbench in SystemVerilog
This repository contains a SystemVerilog-based testbench for verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer, without using UVM. The testbench includes testcases, functional coverage, and self-checking mechanisms to validate the FIFO design.

Features
Testcases covering normal operations, boundary conditions (full, empty, overflow, underflow), and randomized stimulus.

Driver & Monitor to generate input transactions and capture DUT responses.

Scoreboard for result comparison and validation.

Functional Coverage to ensure all scenarios are exercised.
